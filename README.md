# CRUD-manager

## My educational project for second course
***
This is Simple Web service receiving data from the user and writing them to the database. After adding data to the database, it is possible to delete and edit them.. A server and a CRUD-api have been written for the project to access and manipulate records in the database. The client part and data collection from the form have also been worked out. I used the templating engine (EJS) for Express Framework and implemented server-side rendering of the application. The client-side of API usage is implemented in pure JavaScript. **Project requires the dotenv environment variables.**
